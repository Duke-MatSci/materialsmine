# materialsmine
MaterialsMine App

## :high_brightness: Installation
Make sure to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine first, then `git clone` the repo and run `cmd` below to instantiate or terminate the application.

Windows OS: 
- Be sure to run the Docker installer as an administrator
- If the Docker engine fails to start, install the latest WSL2 Linux kernel update package by following Step 4 [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)



# :warning: ADVISORY :warning:
> Before running the steps below, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Duke-MatSci/materialsmine/blob/develop/resfulservice/misc/README.md) to retrieve and deploy required environment variables

> Install nvm [windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows#install-nvm-windows-nodejs-and-npm), for mac `brew install nvm`

## :high_brightness: Testing
To avoid testing failure, install nvm & copy the command below and run in the project root directory.

```bash
npm i && cd app && npm i && cd ../resfulservice && npm i && cd ..
```

## :high_brightness: Starting All Application Services
Run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose build
```
Note: The build might stall at first try. If this occurs, repeat the previous step.


To start all services after the first or initial build
```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you prefer to start all services after the first or initial build in detachable mode
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To shutdown/terminate all services & unmount volumes
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
